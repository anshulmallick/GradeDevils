The process starts at specific locations called origins of replication. Enzymes like helicase unwind the double helix, creating a replication fork. Single-strand binding proteins keep the strands apart. Primase synthesizes RNA primers to initiate synthesis. DNA polymerase III adds nucleotides in a 5 to 3 direction. The leading strand is synthesized continuously, while the lagging strand is synthesized in Okazaki fragments. DNA polymerase I replaces RNA primers with DNA, and DNA ligase seals the gaps. The result is two identical DNA molecules, each with one old and one new strand, following the semi-conservative model of replication.'\n",
